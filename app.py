        # Welcome to "Linear models and their presentation" ðŸ‘‹

        Aim of this course is to learn what linear models are, how to 
        build and interpret them. This course is organized by [AI Education](https://github.com/aiedu-courses) team. 
        Final project that you're seing right now is made by me, [@timofann](https://github.com/timofann).
        Feel free to write or contribute if you have some questions about project, issues, ideas for improvement or offers.

        **ðŸ‘ˆ Select a stage from the dropdown on the left** to see all
        of what we've learnt!
